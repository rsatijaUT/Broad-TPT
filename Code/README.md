This folder contains the following scripts:

1. MSM construction: adapted from PyEMMA tutorials and returns a reproducible MSM object that corresponds to the correct autocorrelation function of the end-to-end distance in the all-atom IN trajectory.

2. TPT estimation from IN trajectories and MSMs: custom-written mathematica notebook to estimate transition path time distribution from rate matrix in MSM. Also calculates exact distribution in IN for comparison.

3. 2D Langevin dynamics: numerical integration of 2D overdamped Langevin dynamics and calculation of transition path times.
